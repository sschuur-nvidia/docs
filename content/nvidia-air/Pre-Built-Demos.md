NVIDIA Air offers many pre-built simulations in the {{<exlink url="https://air.nvidia.com/demos" text="Demo Marketplace">}}. These simulations, also called labs or demos, can be spun-up anytime as copies in your account. They are completely yours to learn from, explore, destroy and rebuild. The labs span a wide range of topics and environments. Some labs provide step-by step instructions to teach you about something, other labs show off different fabric options for a controlled topology. Some labs demonstrate full-fledged configurations fit for large data centers and run a three-tier spine-leaf architecture. 

Navigate to the {{<exlink url="https://air.nvidia.com/demos" text="Demo Marketplace">}} in Air.
